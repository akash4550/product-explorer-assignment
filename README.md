🚀 Product ExplorerFull-Stack Headless Scraping & Data OrchestrationProduct Explorer is a robust, full-stack application engineered to extract, process, and visualize structured product data. Unlike simple scrapers, this platform features a fully decoupled architecture built on strict TypeScript definitions and is Dockerized for enterprise-grade portability.🛰️ Live DeploymentDemo: product-explorer-assign.netlify.app🏗️ Architectural Excellence1. Headless Browser OrchestrationThe backend leverages Playwright to navigate and extract data from dynamic web sources. I implemented ethical rate-limiting and custom selector logic to ensure data extraction is both reliable and respectful of target server resources.2. End-to-End Type SafetyBy utilizing TypeScript across the entire stack, the application maintains a "Single Source of Truth." Shared interfaces between the scraping scripts (Backend) and the UI (Frontend) minimize runtime errors and accelerate the development lifecycle.3. Containerization & PortabilityThe system is fully containerized using Docker.Multi-Container Orchestration: A custom docker-compose.yml manages the lifecycle of both the Node.js backend and the web environment.Consistency: This ensures that the headless browser environment (Playwright dependencies) remains identical across local development, testing, and production.🛠️ Tech StackLayerTechnologyFrontendTypeScript, Modern CSS, HTML (Deployed on Netlify)BackendNode.js, TypeScript, Playwright (Automation)DevOpsDocker, Docker ComposeDeploymentRender (API), Netlify (Client)📁 System StructureBashproduct-explorer-assignment/

🚀 Key Engineering FeaturesAutomated Data Pipeline: Triggers headless browser instances to scrape and transform raw HTML into structured JSON.Decoupled API Design: The backend acts as a standalone service, allowing the frontend to be swapped or scaled independently.CI/CD Ready: Configured for continuous deployment with zero-configuration triggers on Git push.⚙️ Development SetupUsing Docker (Recommended)Bash# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Lakwal/product-explorer.git
cd product-explorer

# Spin up the entire stack
docker-compose up --build
Manual SetupBackend: Navigate to /backend, run npm install, and npm run dev.Frontend: Navigate to /frontend, run npm install, and npm start.
